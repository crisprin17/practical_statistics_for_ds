    "# Standard deviation by hand\n",
    "In the video, we talked about measures of variability, and discussed standard deviation as the measure that is used most commonly. It's pretty important that you have a grasp on this concept, as interviewers will likely hit on it early on in the process through a coding assignment or something more conceptual.\n",
